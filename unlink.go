// 	The  operation  of shm_unlink() is analogous to unlink(2): it removes a
// 	shared memory object name, and, once all processes  have  unmapped  the
// 	object, de-allocates and destroys the contents of the associated memory
// 	region.  After a successful shm_unlink(),  attempts  to  shm_open()  an
// 	object  with  the same name will fail (unless O_CREAT was specified, in
// 	which case a new, distinct object is created).
